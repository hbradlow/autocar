## About
### A fully autonomous car that can fetch items for you. It uses an Electric Imp to control the car, and a Raspberry Pi to stream video. The video is processed by a flask server, and control commands are relayed back to the Imp cloud service. The imp controller spoofs the commands on the RC radio controller.

## Examples and Demos
